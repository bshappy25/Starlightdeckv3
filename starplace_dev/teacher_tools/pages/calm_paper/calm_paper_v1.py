# Calm Paper (Retro) — STARPLACE Edition
**Goal:** a stable, “enhance once” app that can be extended later by your **STARPLACE / SLD Hub** (admin gateway), while still letting you do quick hotfixes in the folder.

This app is **static-host friendly** (GitHub Pages / any web server), **screenshot-first** (best for constrained viewing windows), and supports **exactly 3 upgrade packs**:
- **Radiant Pages**
- **Noir Pages**
- **Vintage Pages**

## Your S-level decisions (captured)

- **S1**: New folder inside **STARPLACE** (Starplace gets its own “teacher tools” hub).
- **S2**: Accounts/sync “coming soon”; everything so far = **base game**.
- **S3**: Manual JSON + asset uploads (**A**) + allow quick mods (hotfix-safe).
- **S4**: Packs include **music + stamps + paper textures** (templates are fixed).
- **S5**: Unlock via **Careon deposit unlock** (codes/credits minted in hub).
- **S6**: Works offline-ish; hub enhances when available (**C**).
- **S7**: No approval workflow needed (**A**).
- **S8**: Screenshot primary; downloads optional later (**B**).
- **S9**: Shared “App Shell” would help STARPLACE overall.
- **S10**: Versioned catalogs (**B**) e.g. `catalog.v1.json`, `catalog.v2.json`.
- **S11**: Minimal UI: pack selection via dropdown (no gallery).
- **S12**: **D** = Hub integration with SLD / admin gateway.
