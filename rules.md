!Users! — Starlight Deck
Identity & Persistence
Each user is identified by a username set at session start. Currently, usernames live only in st.session_state — closing the tab means losing your identity entirely. A persistent user store (SQLite or equivalent) is required before launch so that balances, history, and VIP status survive across sessions.

VIP Tiers
VIP status is a reflection of engagement, not rank. There are no leaderboards, no public standings. Tiers are personal milestones — quiet acknowledgments that a user has been showing up.

■A cosmic veteran. The journey is the point.
Tiers update automatically based on current balance. They are not locked in — if a balance drops, the tier reflects that honestly.

Community Participation
Users can participate in the collective in two ways:
SLD Network Fund — A shared pool that grows passively. Every time a user redeems a code, 5% of the value flows into the fund automatically. When the fund hits milestones (e.g. 1,000 
■), everyone benefits. No individual is credited. No one "wins" it.
Community Phrases (The Ticker) — For 100 
■, any user can submit a phrase (max 20 characters) that scrolls across the top of the experience. This is collective expression, not advertising. The cost exists because the phrase has real weight — it becomes part of the shared space.

Estrella & the User
Estrella is not a feature users "unlock." She is a reflective companion who appears at specific, meaningful points in a user's session — never randomly, never on demand (outside of the final Classic Mode question). A user does not interact with Estrella so much as receive her when the moment is right.
Estrella's appearances are tied to session milestones, not user tiers or history. Every user gets the same touchpoints regardless of how long they've been playing.

What a User Is Not
A user is not a player in a competitive sense. There is no head-to-head, no leaderboard, no "best" user. The entire system is designed so that users exist in relation to their own journey and to the collective — never to each other as opponents.
